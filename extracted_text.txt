**Pizza Recipe**

### Introduction

I used to love pizzas with goat's cheese, spinach and caramelised onion. All of these ingredients are now off limits but I've discovered with a bit of creativity pizzas can still be enjoyed.

### Making Your Own Pizza Base

If you don't have time to make your own pizza base then you can buy freshly made ones in the chilled section of most supermarkets. Though do check the ingredients. An alternative, if you are avoiding yeast, you could use ready made frozen pastry or a tortilla wrap.

### Fresh Pizza Bases

This should make around 4

* 17oz (500g) of strong white or wholemeal bread flour or wheat-free flour
* 1 sachet of dried yeast
* 1 dessertspoonful of sugar
* 2 tablespoonfuls of olive oil
* 300ml of lukewarm water, with a little extra

### Sieving and Mixing

Sieve the flour into a large mixing bowl and make a bowl. In a separate dish mix the yeast, sugar, oil and water together then add to the flour. Mix it all together into a large dough ball. Then pop onto a floured worktop and knead it for a few minutes. Pop it back into the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel and then leave it in a warm room (or by a sunny window) for an hour or so until it has doubled in size.

### Toppings

Options: stir in some shredded chicken and a spoonful of ricotta cheese. Season with salt and pepper.

### Baking

Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F). Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch (6 mm). Place the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Top with your desired toppings. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are cooked through.

### Serving

Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice and serve hot. Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!

**Homemade Beef Burgers**

### Ingredients

*   14oz (400g) fresh, organic mince
*   1 finely chopped red onion
*   2 finely chopped garlic cloves
*   1 egg, beaten

### Instructions

1.  Use your hands to mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Then make small patties, depending on your preferred size of burger. Cook by grilling or barbecuing. Immediately freeze any leftover burgers that can be defrosted and cooked another day.

### Toppings

*   Obviously tomato based toppings are out so this is where you can have fun experimenting.
*   Try spreading the base with ricotta or mascarpone cheese, adding chopped peppers, red onions, sweetcorn or chicken. Other good combinations include caramelised red onions (see recipe without the vinegar) with ricotta and fresh basil.

### Homemade Pizza Dough

*   hour or so until the dough has grown in size. Then, again on a floured surface, knead it again. If you're not going to use it straightaway then wrap it up either in cling film or pop it in a freezer bag and store in the fridge. Allow it to come to room temperature for about 15 minutes before you need to start rolling it out into bases.
*   Then add your toppings and bake in the oven, in an olive-oiled baking tray, at 200C for 10-12 minutes.

### Desserts

#### Blueberry and Kiwi Pavlova

Serves 4 - 6

*   8oz (250g) caster sugar
*   4 egg whites
*   2 teaspoons of cornflour

This is an easy yet impressive dessert and you can change the topping to suit your own taste.

Preheat the oven to 150C and line a baking tray with baking paper. This will give you a rectangle shaped pavlova. If you prefer a round shape then line a pizza tray with baking paper. Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff and then slowly and gradually add in the sugar and finally the cornflour and vinegar. Tip the mixture onto the prepared tray and spread out using a knife. Pop in the oven for an hour then turn the oven off and leave for a further hour. Remove the pavlova when it has cooled and cover with whipped cream, pile on the berries and sliced kiwi fruit and dust with icing sugar.

#### Rice Pudding

Serves 4

*   11oz (325g) of Arborio rice
*   1.5 litres of full-fat milk, almond or coconut milk
*   4 tablespoonfuls of maple syrup

Combine all the ingredients in a heavy-based saucepan and gently bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for around 30 minutes, stirring regularly to make sure it doesn't stick to the pan. You may need to add a little more milk if it starts to dry out. Once the rice is cooked and creamy, remove from the heat and let it cool. Serve warm or chilled, garnished with a sprinkle of cinnamon if desired.

**more milk during the cooking time to prevent the rice from drying out. Serve drizzled with maple syrup or with fresh blueberries or stewed apples.**

### Tiramisu

Serves 4 -6

*   8 homemade fairy cakes (see recipe) or shop-bought fairy cakes
*   8oz (250g tub) mascarpone cheese
*   568ml of double cream
*   4 heaped tablespoonfuls of sieved icing sugar
*   300ml strong coffee

Slice the fairy cakes and arrange half in a glass bowl. Gently pour around half of the coffee over the cakes ensuring they are just soaked. In a separate bowl whisk together the cream, sugar and cheese. Spread half this mixture over the cakes and then repeat another layer of cakes and coffee and finish with a layer of the cream and cheese. Sprinkle some icing sugar or coffee granules over the top to finish. Chill in the fridge until ready to serve.

### Toffee Tart

This is perfect for when you need something for your sweet tooth. It has a crumbly shortbread base and is topped with caramel sauce. A bit like millionaire shortbread but without the chocolate.

Serves 6

*   6oz (170g) plain flour
*   4oz (110g) butter
*   2oz (55g) sugar
*   1 tin of Carnation Cook with Caramel (ingredients are sugar and milk

**Apple and Pear Crumble Recipe**

**Double or Whipping Cream to Serve**

Line a round cake tin with baking paper and heat the oven to 180C. In a food processor blitz the sugar, flour, and butter until they resemble breadcrumbs. Tip the lot into the cake tin and press in until everything is smooth. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden, and allow to cool. Spread the caramel sauce over the top of the base and chill. Serve with whipped or double cream. You could also add blueberries or some slices of cooked apple.

**Note:** Depending on the size of your tin, you may find you have some extra mixture left over. You shape into small balls and flatten them to make shortbread biscuits.

**Apple and Pear Crumble**

**Serves 4**

*   3 apples, peeled cored and cubed
*   2 pears, peeled cored and cubed
*   1 spoonful of brown sugar or honey
*   5oz (150g) plain flour
*   1.5oz (50g) brown or white sugar
*   1.5oz (50g) cold, chopped butter

Heat the oven to 190C. Put the apples and pears in a heavy-based saucepan and scatter a small handful of brown sugar or the honey over the top. Just cover with water and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Put the flour in a bowl and gently, using your fingertips, rub in the butter until it looks like breadcrumbs. Then add the sugar. Drain the fruit and place in an ovenproof dish. Cover the fruit mixture with the crumble mixture and bake in the oven for 35 minutes. Serve with double cream or ice-cream (with allowed ingredients).

**Cheesecake**

For this recipe I have suggested using digestive biscuits. However if you are being very strict and want to use fresh produce then I suggest using shortbread biscuits or fresh cookies from the bakery section.

**Serves 6-8**

* 8oz (220g) digestive, shortbread biscuits or fresh cookies
* 4oz (110g) butter
* 8oz (250g) ricotta cheese
* 8oz (250g) mascarpone cheese
* 2 large or 3 medium eggs
* 3.5g (100g) sugar
* 100ml double cream

Preheat oven to 160C. Line a spring-form cake tin with baking paper.

Use a food processor to whiz the biscuits/shortbread/cookies into crumbs. Melt the butter and stir into the biscuits. Press into the lined tin and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.

In a separate bowl, blend together the cheeses, cream, sugar and eggs. Pour into the prepared tin and bake in the oven for 160C.

Allow to cool and then top with fresh blueberries and drizzle with toffee sauce.

**For sauce:** 150ml double cream, 50g butter, 50g light muscovado sugar. Melt the ingredients together in a small pan, stirring constantly until the sauce turns a golden colour. Drizzle over cheesecake.

The provided image is a recipe for Peanut Butter Fudge. The recipe includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the dish.

**Preheat the oven to 190C and line a rectangle brownie tin with baking paper. Pop the oats into a large mixing bowl and slowly melt the butter, sugar and syrup together. Mix into the oats making sure you stir it all well together. Press the ingredients firmly into the tin and bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes when the flapjacks should look golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool otherwise it will turn into a crumbly mess.**

**Peanut Butter Fudge**

If you are okay with peanut butter then this is ideal when the chocolate cravings hit. I always find peanut butter a bit tricky to try and measure so I have used a whole jar for this. It does yield a good size tray of fudge though which may take a while to work through. So you may want to tweak the quantities accordingly.

1 jar of pure smooth or crunchy peanut butter with no added ingredients (Whole Earth is a good one)

4 tablespoonfuls of honey, maple syrup or agave nectar

In a heavy based saucepan gently melt the peanut butter and honey together. This won't take long so be careful the mixture doesn't burn. Beat well together, spread into a lined dish and then chill in the fridge for 1-2 hours. Mark into square before serving.

**Shortbread**

8oz (225g) butter

4oz (110g) icing sugar

4oz (110g) cornflour

8oz (225g) plain flour

Preheat the oven to 150C and grease a baking tray. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Then gradually add the dry ingredients. Use your hands to now the mixture together until it is smooth. Press it into a lined tin and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool completely before cutting into squares.

*   4oz (110g) brown sugar
*   4oz (110g) plain flour

*   a little milk to add

**Preheat the oven to 170C and line a loaf tin with baking paper. Cream the butter and sugar together then gradually add the eggs, flour and baking powder then the coffee. If the mixture is too dry you may want to add the milk to make the consistency less thick. Pour into the prepared tin and bake in the oven for one hour. Insert a long skewer into the middle of the cake to check it has cooked thoroughly. If it comes out sticky then leave the loaf to bake in the oven for another 15 minutes.**

Optional: Dust with icing sugar or drizzle with icing.
